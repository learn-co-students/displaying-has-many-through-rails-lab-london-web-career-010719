<h1>Appointment</h1>

<h4>Doctor: <%= link_to @appointment.doctor.name, doctor_path(@appointment.doctor) %></h4>
<h4>Patient: <%= link_to @appointment.patient.name, patient_path(@appointment.patient) %></h4>
<h4>Time: <%= @appointment.appointment_datetime.strftime("%B %d, %Y at %H:%M") %></h4>

<!--Create an Appointment#show page that shows the date, time, patient, and doctor for that particular appointment. Note that there should NOT be an Appointment#index page –– we don't want to have all of the appointments on display for anyone to see.  -->
